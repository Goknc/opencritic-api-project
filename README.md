# opencritic-api-project
This is my first project using React and Tailwind CSS. In this project, I used the OpenCritic API to create a structure that displays popular games, Hall of Fame games, and game categories on the homepage. Additionally, the app includes a search feature to find games and detailed game pages with reviews.
